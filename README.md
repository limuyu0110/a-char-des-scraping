# a-char-des-scraping

Serving as part of my Final Project of Digital Image Processing

### Description

The whole project temporarily aims at generating cartoon faces using natural language description.
And this repo collects the dataset needed for GAN training.

The source website is [getchu.com](getchu.com), which is blocked in PRC. To run this code in China,
make sure the socks 5 proxy is set on port 1080.

### Tips
1. Find it really difficult to build cookies for there are 18x pages requiring relevant messages
2. Following the routine of pcscraping... Firstly dump the urls of all pages
